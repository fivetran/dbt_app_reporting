# dbt_app_reporting vNEXTRELEASE

## Under the Hood
- Addition of a section tag within the README so the model descriptions may be accessible within the Fivetran UI for Quickstart.

# dbt_app_reporting v0.4.0
[PR #21](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_app_reporting/pull/21) includes the following updates:

## ðŸš¨ Breaking hanges ðŸš¨
- Identifier variables for the following packages have been updated for consistency with the source name and compatibility with the union schema feature. See the package's changelog for a full list of changes.
  - [dbt_apple_store](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#dbt_apple_store-v040)
  - [dbt_google_play](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_microsoft_ads/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#dbt_google_play-v040)

## Feature update ðŸŽ‰
- Unioning capability! This adds the ability to union source data from multiple app_reporting connectors. Refer to the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_app_reporting/blob/main/README.md#union-multiple-connectors) for more details.
- Added a `source_relation` column in each upstream model for tracking the source of each record.
  - The `source_relation` column is also persisted from the upstream models to the end models.

## Under the hood
- Included auto-releaser GitHub Actions workflow to automate future releases.

# dbt_app_reporting v0.3.2
## Bug Fixes
[PR #19](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_app_reporting/pull/19) includes the following update:
- Shortened the field description for `source_type` in the upstream [dbt_apple_store source](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_store_source) package. This was causing an error if the persist docs config was enabled because the description size exceeded warehouse constraints.

# dbt_app_reporting v0.3.1
## Bug Fixes
[PR #16](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_app_reporting/pull/16) includes the following bug fix.
- Included the `country_long` field in the unique combination of columns test for the `app_reporting__country_report`. It has been identified that Apple will sometimes provide records with different `country_long` names; however, they will be the same `country_short`. This is due to some countries having multiple `country_long` spelling variations. 

# dbt_app_reporting v0.3.0

## Bug Fixes:
[PR #14](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_app_reporting/pull/14) includes the following changes:
- This version of the transform package points to breaking changes in the upstream [Google Play](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_play_source/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) and [Apple Store](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_store_source/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) source packages in which the [country code](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_store_source/blob/main/seeds/apple_store_country_codes.csv) mapping tables were updated to align with Apple's [format and inclusion list](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-store-localizations/) of country names.
  - This is a ðŸš¨**breaking change**ðŸš¨ as you will need to re-seed (`dbt seed --full-refresh`) the `google_play__country_codes` [file](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_play_source/blob/main/seeds/google_play__country_codes.csv) and `apple_store_country_codes` [file](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_store_source/blob/main/seeds/apple_store_country_codes.csv) again.

## Under the Hood:
[PR #13](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_app_reporting/pull/13) includes the following changes:
- Incorporated the new `fivetran_utils.drop_schemas_automation` macro into the end of each Buildkite integration test job.
- Updated the pull request [templates](/.github).
