# dbt_app_reporting v0.6.0

[PR #28](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_app_reporting/pull/28) includes the following updates:

## Breaking Change for dbt Core < 1.9.6
> *Note: This is not relevant to Fivetran Quickstart users.*

Migrated `freshness` from a top-level source property to a source `config` in alignment with [recent updates](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/11506) from dbt Core ([Google Play Source v0.5.0](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_play_source/releases/tag/v0.5.0) and [Apple App Store Source v0.6.0](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_store_source/releases/tag/v0.6.0)). This will resolve the following deprecation warning that users running dbt >= 1.9.6 may have received:

```
[WARNING]: Deprecated functionality
Found `freshness` as a top-level property of `google_play` and `apple_store` in file
`models/src_google_play.yml` and `models/src_apple_store.yml`. The `freshness` top-level property should be moved
into the `config` of `google_play` and `apple_store`.
```

**IMPORTANT:** Users running dbt Core < 1.9.6 will not be able to utilize freshness tests in this release or any subsequent releases, as older versions of dbt will not recognize freshness as a source `config` and therefore not run the tests.

If you are using dbt Core < 1.9.6 and want to continue running Google Play and Apple App Store freshness tests, please elect **one** of the following options:
  1. (Recommended) Upgrade to dbt Core >= 1.9.6
  2. Do not upgrade your installed version of the `app_reporting` package. Pin your dependency on v0.5.0 in your `packages.yml` file.
  3. Utilize a dbt [override](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/overrides) to overwrite the package's `google_play` source and `apple_store` source and apply freshness via the previous release top-level property route. This will require you to copy and paste the entirety of the previous release `src_google_play.yml` and `src_apple_store.yml` files and add an `overrides: google_play_source` and`overrides: apple_store_source` property, respectively.

## Under the Hood
- Updates to ensure integration tests use latest version of dbt.

# dbt_app_reporting v0.5.0

## Breaking Changes: dbt_apple_store v0.5.0 
- This package has been updated to align with upstream schema changes introduced in version v0.5.0 of the `dbt_apple_store` package. For more information on the breaking changes, refer to the `dbt_apple_store` [release notes](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_store/releases/tag/v0.5.0).

## Documentation
- Added Quickstart model counts to README. ([#26](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_app_reporting/pull/26))
- Corrected references to connectors and connections in the README. ([#26](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_app_reporting/pull/26)) 

## Under the Hood
- Addition of a section tag within the README so the model descriptions may be accessible within the Fivetran UI for Quickstart.

# dbt_app_reporting v0.4.0
[PR #21](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_app_reporting/pull/21) includes the following updates:

## 🚨 Breaking hanges 🚨
- Identifier variables for the following packages have been updated for consistency with the source name and compatibility with the union schema feature. See the package's changelog for a full list of changes.
  - [dbt_apple_store](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#dbt_apple_store-v040)
  - [dbt_google_play](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_microsoft_ads/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#dbt_google_play-v040)

## Feature update 🎉
- Unioning capability! This adds the ability to union source data from multiple app_reporting connectors. Refer to the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_app_reporting/blob/main/README.md#union-multiple-connectors) for more details.
- Added a `source_relation` column in each upstream model for tracking the source of each record.
  - The `source_relation` column is also persisted from the upstream models to the end models.

## Under the hood
- Included auto-releaser GitHub Actions workflow to automate future releases.

# dbt_app_reporting v0.3.2
## Bug Fixes
[PR #19](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_app_reporting/pull/19) includes the following update:
- Shortened the field description for `source_type` in the upstream [dbt_apple_store source](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_store_source) package. This was causing an error if the persist docs config was enabled because the description size exceeded warehouse constraints.

# dbt_app_reporting v0.3.1
## Bug Fixes
[PR #16](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_app_reporting/pull/16) includes the following bug fix.
- Included the `country_long` field in the unique combination of columns test for the `app_reporting__country_report`. It has been identified that Apple will sometimes provide records with different `country_long` names; however, they will be the same `country_short`. This is due to some countries having multiple `country_long` spelling variations. 

# dbt_app_reporting v0.3.0

## Bug Fixes:
[PR #14](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_app_reporting/pull/14) includes the following changes:
- This version of the transform package points to breaking changes in the upstream [Google Play](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_play_source/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) and [Apple Store](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_store_source/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) source packages in which the [country code](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_store_source/blob/main/seeds/apple_store_country_codes.csv) mapping tables were updated to align with Apple's [format and inclusion list](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-store-localizations/) of country names.
  - This is a 🚨**breaking change**🚨 as you will need to re-seed (`dbt seed --full-refresh`) the `google_play__country_codes` [file](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_play_source/blob/main/seeds/google_play__country_codes.csv) and `apple_store_country_codes` [file](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_store_source/blob/main/seeds/apple_store_country_codes.csv) again.

## Under the Hood:
[PR #13](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_app_reporting/pull/13) includes the following changes:
- Incorporated the new `fivetran_utils.drop_schemas_automation` macro into the end of each Buildkite integration test job.
- Updated the pull request [templates](/.github).
